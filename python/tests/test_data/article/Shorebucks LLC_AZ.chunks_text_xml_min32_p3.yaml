    3.4 Exclusive Use .
     3.4.1 Restriction.
  parent_text: |
    <Default> 3.4.1 <Restriction-section> Restriction. <Restriction> If and for as long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease beyond any applicable grace period and is not holding over beyond the expiration of the Lease Term , Landlord shall not (i) lease any space in the Building to any tenant who will engage in the primary business of coworking office space (i.e., shared or private office space available for a fee to members which includes ancillary amenities and support services) as operated by Tenant (“ Exclusive Use ”); or (ii) engage in the Exclusive Use at the Project. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord may construct speculative office suites. The rights granted in this section are personal to the original named Tenant in this Lease (and any Permitted Assignee) and shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: (a) no portion of the Premises is sublet to anyone (other than a Permitted Transferee ) at the time Landlord would otherwise seek to lease space in violation of this restriction; and (b) this Lease has not been assigned to anyone (other than a Permitted Assignee ) at the time Landlord would otherwise seek to lease space in violation of this restriction. Landlord’s obligations under this section shall automatically cease and terminate and Landlord may lease space in the Building free and clear of the restrictions imposed by this section should the Premises cease to be used primarily for the Exclusive Use or if Tenant has ceased operating the Premises for more than <CeasedOperatingthePremises> 90 </CeasedOperatingthePremises> consecutive days (except due to casualty, condemnation, or as a result of Alterations by Tenant). The rights granted in this section shall not apply to leases in existence as of the Date of this Lease (or any replacement for such leases or expansion of the premises leased under them, whether by right of first refusal, right of first offer, or other expansion right or similar right previously granted by Landlord, or otherwise, or by any of the successors, assigns, sublessees, or transferees of the tenants under such existing leases), which lease(s) currently permit the premises leased under them to be used for the Exclusive Use or for any lawful use. </Restriction> </Restriction-section> 3.4.2 <LimitationofRemedies-section> Limitation of Remedies. <LimitationofRemedies> If Landlord violates this section by leasing space in the Building for a use that includes the Exclusive Use , and Landlord does not cure such violation within <DoesNotCureSuchViolation> 90 days </DoesNotCureSuchViolation> after receipt of Tenant's notice of the violation, Tenant shall have all remedies provided by law; provided that, Tenant expressly waives any right to terminate this Lease as a result of such violation. If another tenant of the Building violates a provision in its lease by engaging in the Exclusive Use , upon Tenant's request, Landlord will notify such tenant of its default and demand in writing that it cease and desist from such unauthorized use. This will be Landlord's sole liability for any such use by another tenant except that, at Tenant's request, Landlord will assign to Tenant all of Landlord's rights to enforce the defaulting tenant's lease so as to preclude the use in violation of the Exclusive Use . </LimitationofRemedies> </LimitationofRemedies-section> 3.4.3 <Enforceability-section> Enforceability. <Enforceability> Landlord’s obligations under this section have been assumed as an accommodation to Tenant and as an inducement to Tenant to enter into this Lease.

    <Default> 3.4.1 <Restriction-section> Restriction. <Restriction> If and for as long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease beyond any applicable grace period and is not holding over beyond the expiration of the Lease Term , Landlord shall not (i) lease any space in the Building to any tenant who will engage in the primary business of coworking office space (i.e., shared or private office space available for a fee to members which includes ancillary amenities and support services) as operated by Tenant (“ Exclusive Use ”); or (ii) engage in the Exclusive Use at the Project. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord may construct speculative office suites. The rights granted in this section are personal to the original named Tenant in this Lease (and any Permitted Assignee) and shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: (a) no portion of the Premises is sublet to anyone (other than a Permitted Transferee ) at the time Landlord would otherwise seek to lease space in violation of this restriction; and (b) this Lease has not been assigned to anyone (other than a Permitted Assignee ) at the time Landlord would otherwise seek to lease space in violation of this restriction. Landlord’s obligations under this section shall automatically cease and terminate and Landlord may lease space in the Building free and clear of the restrictions imposed by this section should the Premises cease to be used primarily for the Exclusive Use or if Tenant has ceased operating the Premises for more than <CeasedOperatingthePremises> 90 </CeasedOperatingthePremises> consecutive days (except due to casualty, condemnation, or as a result of Alterations by Tenant). The rights granted in this section shall not apply to leases in existence as of the Date of this Lease (or any replacement for such leases or expansion of the premises leased under them, whether by right of first refusal, right of first offer, or other expansion right or similar right previously granted by Landlord, or otherwise, or by any of the successors, assigns, sublessees, or transferees of the tenants under such existing leases), which lease(s) currently permit the premises leased under them to be used for the Exclusive Use or for any lawful use. </Restriction> </Restriction-section> 3.4.2 <LimitationofRemedies-section> Limitation of Remedies. <LimitationofRemedies> If Landlord violates this section by leasing space in the Building for a use that includes the Exclusive Use , and Landlord does not cure such violation within <DoesNotCureSuchViolation> 90 days </DoesNotCureSuchViolation> after receipt of Tenant's notice of the violation, Tenant shall have all remedies provided by law; provided that, Tenant expressly waives any right to terminate this Lease as a result of such violation. If another tenant of the Building violates a provision in its lease by engaging in the Exclusive Use , upon Tenant's request, Landlord will notify such tenant of its default and demand in writing that it cease and desist from such unauthorized use. This will be Landlord's sole liability for any such use by another tenant except that, at Tenant's request, Landlord will assign to Tenant all of Landlord's rights to enforce the defaulting tenant's lease so as to preclude the use in violation of the Exclusive Use . </LimitationofRemedies> </LimitationofRemedies-section> 3.4.3 <Enforceability-section> Enforceability. <Enforceability> Landlord’s obligations under this section have been assumed as an accommodation to Tenant and as an inducement to Tenant to enter into this Lease. It is Landlord’s and Tenant’s belief that the use restriction granted to Tenant in this section is reasonable in territory, time, and person and otherwise meets applicable legal criteria so as to be enforceable under antitrust laws. However, Landlord makes no representations, express or implied, as to the enforceability of the foregoing use restriction, or whether such restrictions violate any applicable state or federal laws. If this use restriction is found to be in violation of any state or federal antitrust laws by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, Landlord will be absolved from liability for breach of this use restriction. </Enforceability> </Enforceability-section> 3.4.4 <WaiveronExtension-section> Waiver on Extension. <WaiveronExtension> Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Lease to the contrary, if Tenant exercises an option to extend the Lease Term at any time when Landlord is concurrently in violation of this section, and, at the time of Tenant’s election of its option to extend Tenant has failed to enforce its rights under this section for Landlord’s breach of its obligations within <CeasestheViolation> 90 days </CeasestheViolation> from the date Tenant notifies Landlord of the violation, in either of such events, Tenant shall be deemed to have waived its rights and remedies available under this section. Further, Tenant shall have no remedy for a violation of this section if another tenant or occupant in the Building violates the Exclusive Use by manner or use of its premises and (i) Landlord provides notice of the lease violation to such other tenant or occupant in the Building; and (ii) either the other tenant or occupant ceases the violation within <TimeDuration> 90 days</TimeDuration> , or Landlord commences an action (or arbitration, if required by such lease) against such other tenant or occupant in the Building, and thereafter uses good-faith efforts to enforce its rights under such lease. </WaiveronExtension> </WaiveronExtension-section> 3.4.5 <NoSolicitation-section> No Solicitation. <NoSolicitation> During the Lease Term , Tenant shall not directly solicit by phone, in person contact, mail, e-mail, direct message, or other form of communication directed to a specific recipient any of Landlord’s Customers (as defined below) for lease, use, or occupancy of space in the Premises in connection with Tenant’s business. “Solicit” shall mean touring, or offering to tour, the Premises; offering or proposing terms to lease a suite in the Premises; entering into a letter of intent or proposal to lease a suite in the Premises; or providing a copy of Tenant’s membership agreement. “Landlord’s Customers” shall mean any person or entity who shall at that time be a tenant, subtenant, or other occupant of any part of the Building.

    5.3 Independent Claims .
     <IndependentClaims> Any claims by Landlord for Base Rent and any claims by Landlord for Percentage Rent may be regarded by Landlord, if it so elects, as two independent claims capable of being presented separately. In the event of any default on the part of Tenant under this Lease, Landlord shall have the privilege of splitting its cause of action so as to permit the institution of a separate suit for Base Rent ; neither the institution of a separate suit, nor the entry of judgment in the suit, shall bar Landlord from bringing a subsequent suit for Percentage Rent , it being the purpose of this agreement expressly to provide that the forbearance on the part of Landlord in the institution of any suit or in the entry of judgment for any part of the rent reserved to Landlord in this Lease, or to sue for, or to include in any judgment, Percentage Rent then due, shall in no way serve as a defense against, nor prejudice a subsequent action for, Percentage Rent . Neither this Lease, nor the method set forth in this Lease for the computation of Percentage Rent , nor any one or more of the agreements contained in this Lease, is intended, nor shall the same ever be construed, so as to (a) create a partnership between Landlord and Tenant, (b) make Landlord and Tenant joint venturers, or (c) make Landlord in any way responsible for the obligations, liabilities, debts, or losses of Tenant. Tenant waives any right to claim in any suit for Percentage Rent that merger or res judicata exists as to any previous suit or any judgment entered in any previous suit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, Percentage Rent shall be deemed earned by Landlord and the property of Landlord upon receipt by Tenant of Gross Revenue representing Percentage Rent , as calculated in accordance with the terms of this Lease. All accrued Percentage Rent shall be held by Tenant in trust for Landlord and promptly paid to Landlord in accordance with the schedule set forth in this section. </IndependentClaims>

    6.8 Consideration for Consent.
     <ConsiderationforConsent> If Tenant effects any transfer, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord a sum equal to (a) the net Rent or other consideration paid to Tenant by any transferee that is in excess of the Rent then being paid by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease for the portion of the Premises so transferred (on a prorated, square footage basis), and (b) any other profit or gain realized by Tenant from the transfer.

The receipt by Landlord of any Rent after default on the part of Tenant (whether the Rent is due before or after the default) shall not excuse any delays as to future Rent payments and shall not be deemed to operate as a waiver of any then-existing default by Tenant or of the right of Landlord to pursue any available remedies. No payment by Tenant, or receipt by Landlord, of a lesser amount than the Rent actually owed under the terms of this Lease shall be deemed to be anything other than a payment on account of the earliest stipulated Rent due.

    35. LETTER OF CREDIT.
     <TenantsExecution> Upon Tenant's execution of this Lease, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an unconditional, irrevocable and transferable standby Letter of Credit in the amount of <StandbyLetterofCredit> $250,000.00 </StandbyLetterofCredit> (the "Letter of Credit"), which Letter of Credit shall be issued by a United States commercial bank which is reasonably acceptable to Landlord with at least a AA- rating as published by <Org> Standard and Poor's Corporation </Org> or at least a Aa3 rating as published by <Org> Moody's </Org> and which has an office in Palm Beach County , <USState> Florida </USState> at which draws can be made under the Letter of Credit, naming Landlord (or its successor as Landlord) as beneficiary and in the form of EXHIBIT "G" to this Lease. Upon issuance of the Letter of Credit, a copy of it shall be attached to this Lease. Landlord reserves the right to periodically review the financial condition of the issuing bank for any Letter of Credit and any renewal or replacement Letter of Credit and if Landlord determines that the issuing bank no longer satisfies the criteria set forth above, Landlord may require a replacement Letter of Credit in form and substance and from a United States bank acceptable to Landlord which satisfies the criteria set forth above. Landlord may draw upon the Letter of Credit at any time Tenant is in default under this Lease without prior notice to Tenant. The Letter of Credit shall have a term of at least <Term> 12 months</Term> , and it shall by its terms be renewed automatically each year by the bank, unless the bank gives written notice to the beneficiary, at least <WrittenNotice> 60 days </WrittenNotice> before the expiration date of the then existing Letter of Credit, that the bank elects that it not be renewed. If Tenant fails to provide a replacement Letter of Credit because the issuing bank no longer satisfies the criteria set forth above or if the Letter of Credit is ever not renewed and has less than 30 days remaining in its term, Tenant shall be in default of the terms of this Lease and Landlord may draw on the Letter of Credit. The Letter of Credit shall be transferable and the proceeds assignable. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all transfer fees incurred. If the financial institution which issued the initial Letter of Credit is ever declared insolvent or closed by the FDIC or other applicable governmental authority or is closed for any other reason (other than periodic branch closures which occur in the normal course of business), then Tenant shall, within 30 days after notice from Landlord, provide a substitute Letter of Credit to Landlord from another financial institution acceptable to Landlord in its sole discretion and which otherwise complies with the terms of this section and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Landlord's attorneys' fees and costs incurred. Tenant agrees and acknowledges that Tenant has no property interest whatsoever in the Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof and that, in the event Tenant becomes a debtor under any chapter of the Federal Bankruptcy Code , neither Tenant, any trustee, nor Tenant's bankruptcy estate shall have any right to restrict or limit Landlord's claim and/or rights to the Letter of Credit and/or the proceeds thereof by application of Section 502(b) (6) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code . Any cure periods for a default by Tenant under this Lease shall not be applicable to a default by Tenant of the terms of this section. The Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a security deposit under this Lease, but rather as a third-party guaranty by the issuing bank guaranteeing all of the Tenant's obligations under this Lease. For purposes of this Lease, the term “ Reduction Date ” shall mean the third anniversary of the Commencement Date and each annual anniversary thereafter. Provided as of each Reduction Date (i) Tenant is not in default of this Lease beyond any applicable grace period, (ii) Tenant has been current in all of its monetary and other obligations under this Lease during the 12 month period preceding the Reduction Date within any applicable grace periods, (iii) Tenant’s financial condition is equal to or better than its financial condition on the Date of this Lease, and (iv) Landlord has not drawn on the Letter of Credit for a default by Tenant, then the required amount of the Letter of Credit (the “ Required Amount ”) may be reduced effective as of the 10th day following each Reduction Date by <LetterofCredit> $50,000.00</LetterofCredit> , and Tenant may deliver to Landlord a new Letter of Credit stating the reduced Required Amount to replace the Letter of Credit then being held by Landlord. </TenantsExecution>
