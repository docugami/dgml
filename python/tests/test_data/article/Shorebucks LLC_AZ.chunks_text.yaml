    The “ Rent Credit Period ” shall be the first nine full calendar months of the Lease Term . Provided that Tenant is not in default of this Lease beyond any applicable grace period at any time during the Rent Credit Period , Tenant shall have a Rent credit in the amount of the Base Rent and Percentage Rent , which credit shall be applied to the installments of Base Rent and Percentage Rent due for those months. Accordingly, if the Commencement Date occurs on a day other than the first day of the month, the prorated Rent for the first partial month of the Lease Term shall be due on the Commencement Date and the Rent Credit Period shall commence on the first day of the first full calendar month of the Lease Term and shall expire on the last day of the ninth full calendar month of the Lease Term . If a default occurs, the Rent credit shall immediately become due and payable in full and this Lease shall be enforced as if there were no such rent abatement or other rent concession. In such case, the abated rent subject to the above credit shall be calculated based on the full initial Base Rent payable under this Lease. If this Lease is terminated as a result of a default by Tenant, then in addition to all other damages and remedies herein provided, Landlord shall be entitled to recover the entire dollar amount of such Rent credit previously granted to Tenant.

The rights granted in this section are personal to the original named Tenant in this Lease (and any Permitted Assignee) and shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: (a) no portion of the Premises is sublet to anyone (other than a Permitted Transferee ) at the time Landlord would otherwise seek to lease space in violation of this restriction; and (b) this Lease has not been assigned to anyone (other than a Permitted Assignee ) at the time Landlord would otherwise seek to lease space in violation of this restriction. Landlord’s obligations under this section shall automatically cease and terminate and Landlord may lease space in the Building free and clear of the restrictions imposed by this section should the Premises cease to be used primarily for the Exclusive Use or if Tenant has ceased operating the Premises for more than 90 consecutive days (except due to casualty, condemnation, or as a result of Alterations by Tenant). The rights granted in this section shall not apply to leases in existence as of the Date of this Lease (or any replacement for such leases or expansion of the premises leased under them, whether by right of first refusal, right of first offer, or other expansion right or similar right previously granted by Landlord, or otherwise, or by any of the successors, assigns, sublessees, or transferees of the tenants under such existing leases), which lease(s) currently permit the premises leased under them to be used for the Exclusive Use or for any lawful use.

It is Landlord’s and Tenant’s belief that the use restriction granted to Tenant in this section is reasonable in territory, time, and person and otherwise meets applicable legal criteria so as to be enforceable under antitrust laws. However, Landlord makes no representations, express or implied, as to the enforceability of the foregoing use restriction, or whether such restrictions violate any applicable state or federal laws.

The net Rent or other consideration paid to Tenant as provided in subsection (a) and the profit or gain as provided in subsection (b) shall be calculated by deducting from the gross Rent or other consideration or profit or gain reasonable and customary real estate brokerage commissions actually paid by Tenant to unaffiliated third parties, tenant improvement allowances, Rent concessions, the actual cost of improvements to the Premises made by Tenant for the transferee, and other direct out- of-pocket costs actually paid by Tenant in connection with the transfer (as long as the costs are commercially reasonable and are commonly incurred by landlords in leasing similar space). Should the transaction involving an assignment of Tenant's interest under this Lease be a sale of multiple assets of Tenant, Landlord shall not be bound by any allocation of the purchase price for such assets which may be included in an agreement between Tenant and the transferee. Rather, the profit or gain on the transfer of Tenant's interest under this Lease as defined in subsection (b) above shall be the fair market value of Tenant's interest under this Lease as of the date of the transfer less the costs of the transaction as generally described above.

    Notwithstanding the provisions of this article, Tenant may enter into license agreements or subleases for office suites without the prior consent of Landlord provided the terms and conditions of this subsection are satisfied, and such license agreements or subleases shall not be considered “transfers” under this section. In licensing or subleasing the Premises, Tenant shall not hold itself out to be a representative of Landlord. The right of Tenant to license or sublease the Premises under this subsection shall in no manner be construed as a waiver of Landlord's rights under this section concerning an assignment of this Lease or sublease of the Premises, or any part of the Premises, for purposes other than the Permitted Use . The form of license agreement or sublease to be used by Tenant shall be subject to Landlord's prior approval and, at a minimum, shall provide that: (a) the office suite user shall comply with all applicable terms and conditions of this Lease as to use of the Premises, including all Rules and Regulations; (b) the license agreement or sublease is expressly subject and subordinate to all of the terms and provisions of this Lease; and (c) unless Landlord elects otherwise, the license agreement or sublease will not survive a termination of this Lease (whether voluntary or involuntary) or resumption of possession of the Premises by Landlord following a default by Tenant. However, the license agreement or sublease shall further provide that if Landlord elects that the license agreement or sublease shall survive a termination of this Lease or resumption of possession of the Premises by Landlord following a default by Tenant, then the transferee will, at the election of the Landlord, attorn to the Landlord and continue to perform its obligations under its license agreement or sublease as if this Lease had not been terminated and the license agreement or sublease were a direct lease between the Landlord and the transferee.

    The failure of a party to insist on the strict performance of any provision of this Lease or to exercise any remedy for any default shall not be construed as a waiver. The waiver of any noncompliance with this Lease shall not prevent subsequent similar noncompliance from being a default. No waiver shall be effective unless expressed in writing and signed by the waiving party. No notice to or demand on a party shall of itself entitle the party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. The receipt by Landlord of any Rent after default on the part of Tenant (whether the Rent is due before or after the default) shall not excuse any delays as to future Rent payments and shall not be deemed to operate as a waiver of any then-existing default by Tenant or of the right of Landlord to pursue any available remedies. No payment by Tenant, or receipt by Landlord, of a lesser amount than the Rent actually owed under the terms of this Lease shall be deemed to be anything other than a payment on account of the earliest stipulated Rent due. No endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment of Rent will be deemed an accord and satisfaction. Landlord may accept the check or payment without prejudice to Landlord's right to recover the balance of the Rent or to pursue any other remedy. It is the intention of the parties that this article will modify the common law rules of waiver and estoppel and the provisions of any statute that might dictate a contrary result.

    Upon Tenant's execution of this Lease, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an unconditional, irrevocable and transferable standby Letter of Credit in the amount of $250,000.00 (the "Letter of Credit"), which Letter of Credit shall be issued by a United States commercial bank which is reasonably acceptable to Landlord with at least a AA- rating as published by Standard and Poor's Corporation or at least a Aa3 rating as published by Moody's and which has an office in Palm Beach County , Florida at which draws can be made under the Letter of Credit, naming Landlord (or its successor as Landlord) as beneficiary and in the form of EXHIBIT "G" to this Lease. Upon issuance of the Letter of Credit, a copy of it shall be attached to this Lease. Landlord reserves the right to periodically review the financial condition of the issuing bank for any Letter of Credit and any renewal or replacement Letter of Credit and if Landlord determines that the issuing bank no longer satisfies the criteria set forth above, Landlord may require a replacement Letter of Credit in form and substance and from a United States bank acceptable to Landlord which satisfies the criteria set forth above. Landlord may draw upon the Letter of Credit at any time Tenant is in default under this Lease without prior notice to Tenant. The Letter of Credit shall have a term of at least 12 months , and it shall by its terms be renewed automatically each year by the bank, unless the bank gives written notice to the beneficiary, at least 60 days before the expiration date of the then existing Letter of Credit, that the bank elects that it not be renewed. If Tenant fails to provide a replacement Letter of Credit because the issuing bank no longer satisfies the criteria set forth above or if the Letter of Credit is ever not renewed and has less than 30 days remaining in its term, Tenant shall be in default of the terms of this Lease and Landlord may draw on the Letter of Credit. The Letter of Credit shall be transferable and the proceeds assignable. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all transfer fees incurred. If the financial institution which issued the initial Letter of Credit is ever declared insolvent or closed by the FDIC or other applicable governmental authority or is closed for any other reason (other than periodic branch closures which occur in the normal course of business), then Tenant shall, within 30 days after notice from Landlord, provide a substitute Letter of Credit to Landlord from another financial institution acceptable to Landlord in its sole discretion and which otherwise complies with the terms of this section and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Landlord's attorneys' fees and costs incurred. Tenant agrees and acknowledges that Tenant has no property interest whatsoever in the Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof and that, in the event Tenant becomes a debtor under any chapter of the Federal Bankruptcy Code , neither Tenant, any trustee, nor Tenant's bankruptcy estate shall have any right to restrict or limit Landlord's claim and/or rights to the Letter of Credit and/or the proceeds thereof by application of Section 502(b) (6) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code . Any cure periods for a default by Tenant under this Lease shall not be applicable to a default by Tenant of the terms of this section. The Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a security deposit under this Lease, but rather as a third-party guaranty by the issuing bank guaranteeing all of the Tenant's obligations under this Lease. For purposes of this Lease, the term “ Reduction Date ” shall mean the third anniversary of the Commencement Date and each annual anniversary thereafter. Provided as of each Reduction Date (i) Tenant is not in default of this Lease beyond any applicable grace period, (ii) Tenant has been current in all of its monetary and other obligations under this Lease during the 12 month period preceding the Reduction Date within any applicable grace periods, (iii) Tenant’s financial condition is equal to or better than its financial condition on the Date of this Lease, and (iv) Landlord has not drawn on the Letter of Credit for a default by Tenant, then the required amount of the Letter of Credit (the “ Required Amount ”) may be reduced effective as of the 10th day following each Reduction Date by $50,000.00 , and Tenant may deliver to Landlord a new Letter of Credit stating the reduced Required Amount to replace the Letter of Credit then being held by Landlord.
